    <title>Bitwise operators</title>
    <warning>
        <p>
            In class, I previously used the symbols <m>\oplus</m> and
            <m>\odot</m> for bitwise OR and AND, respectively. In this
            section, we use different symbols, to match Python's notation:
            &amp; for bitwise AND, | for bitwise OR, and ^ for bitwise XOR.
