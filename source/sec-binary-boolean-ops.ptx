    <title>Binary boolean operators</title>
    <p>
        The set of <term>boolean values</term> is the set <m>\{T, F\}</m>. In this
        section, the word <em>function</em> is used in its mathematical sense.
        Such a function can be thought of as a black box that converts its inputs
        into an output. The inputs are also called <em>arguments</em> and the output
        is called the <em>value</em> of the function. The set of all possible inputs
        of a function <m>T</m> is called the <em>domain</em> of <m>T</m>. The set
        of all possible outputs of <m>T</m> is called the <em>codomain</em> of <m>T</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
        A <term>boolean function</term> is a function that returns a boolean value. A
        <term>boolean operator</term> is a function that takes only boolean values
        as inputs and
        returns a boolean value.
    </p>
    <p>
        A <term>binary boolean operator</term> is a boolean operator that takes two
        boolean values as inputs. We usually use infix notation instead of functional
        notation to represent them. This means a symbol like <m>\circ</m> is placed
        between the two inputs <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> like this: <m>x \circ y</m> to represent the operator
        instead of using the functional notation <m>\circ(x, y)</m>.
    </p>
    <p>   
        A binary boolean operator is <term>commutative</term>
        if the order of the inputs does not affect the output. In symbols, and representing
        the operator, <m>\circ</m>, we have
        <me>
            x \circ y = y \circ x \quad \text{for all $x$, $y$ in the domain of $\circ$}
        </me>
        as the defining property of commutativity.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are six binary boolean operators that are commutative. They are given
        in the tables below. Tables like these are called <term>truth tables</term>,
        because they help us determin when a boolean expression (a combination of
        boolean values and boolean operators) is true and when it is false.
