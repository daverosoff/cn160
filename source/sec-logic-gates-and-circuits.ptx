        <p>
            In this section we will begin to represent logic diagrammatically
            with gates. This will allow us to build circuits that perform
            complex logical operations.

        <title>The Basic Gates</title>
        <p>
            There are seven basic gates available in Logisim Evolution.
            They are the AND, NAND, OR, NOR, XOR, XNOR, and NOT gates,
            pictured in

                        The AND gate is shaped like a capital
                        letter D. The inputs are on the left side of
                        the gate and the output is on the right curved side.

                        The NAND gate resembles the AND gate, but has
                        a small circle on the output side. This circle
                        indicates that the output is inverted.

                        The OR gate is shaped like a boomerang, oriented
                        with its tips at the top and bottom, and concave
                        side on the left. The inputs are on the concave side
                        of the gate and
                        the output is on the convex side.

                        indicates that the output is inverted.

                        The XOR gate is shaped like the OR gate,
                        but with an extra line parallel and adjacent to
                        the concave side. The inputs are on the concave side
                        of the gate and the output is on the convex side.

                The NOT gate is shaped like a triangle with a small circle
                on the output side. This circle indicates that the output
                is inverted.
