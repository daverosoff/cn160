    <title>Standard forms: minterms and maxterms</title>
    <shorttitle>Standard forms</shorttitle>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            In this section we will introduce two standard forms for Boolean
            functions: the <term>minterm</term> and the <term>maxterm</term>.
            Every boolean function can be represented as a sum of minterms or
            as a product of maxterms. Each of these representations leads
            directly to a circuit.
        </p>
        <p>
            Consider the expression <me>
                \bar{x} y z + x \bar{y} z
            </me>.
            If we list out the barred and unbarred versions of all the
            variables that appear in the expression, we get the following:
            <me>
                x, \bar{x}, y, \bar{y}, z, \bar{z}
            </me>.
            These occur in complementary pairs: for any choice of logical
            values of <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, <m>z</m>, exactly one of the
            members of each pair is 1 and the other is 0. <xref ref="table-minterms-three-vars"/>
            summarizes the situation.

        </table>
        <p>
            Each of the rows in the table is called a <term>minterm</term>.
            The name comes from the fact that each row is a product of literals
            (variables or their negations), and the product of literals is
            called a <term>term</term>. The term is called a minterm because
            it is 1 for the combination of inputs that is listed in the row,
            and 0 for all other combinations. The minterm is called
            <term>canonical</term> because it is the simplest possible
            expression for the function.
        </p>

        <title>Minterm canonical form</title>
        <p>
            Look again at <xref ref="table-minterms-three-vars"/>. Notice that
            each minterm is labeled by the integer representation of the
            combination of inputs that makes it 1. For example, <m>m_5</m> is
            1 when <m>x = 1</m>, <m>y = 0</m>, and <m>z = 1</m>, and this
            combination of inputs, that is, the binary number <m>101</m>, is
            the integer 5. The minterm <m>m_7</m> is 1 when <m>x = 1</m>,
            <m>y = 1</m>, and <m>z = 1</m>, and this combination of inputs,
            that is, the binary number <m>111</m>, is the integer 7.
        </p>
        <p>
            Given any truth table for a 3-variable function, we can write down
            the minterm canonical form for the function by adding the minterms
            that are 1 in the truth table. For example, <xref ref="table-truth-tab-3-vars"/>
            corresponds to the minterm canonical form <m>m_1 + m_3 + m_5</m>,
            because minterms <m>m_1</m>, <m>m_3</m>, and <m>m_5</m> are the
            only ones that are 1 in the truth table.

            To represent the minterm form as a circuit, we remember that
            multiplication is AND and addition is OR. So the circuit for
            <m>m_1 + m_3 + m_5</m> is as pictured in <xref ref="figure-minterm-135"/>.

            It is useful to know both forms, because sometimes one is easier
            to work with than the other. One may be easier to build as a

        <title>The maxterm canonical form</title>
        <p>
            The <term>maxterm canonical form</term> is the dual of the
            minterm canonical form. The dual of a function is obtained by
            interchanging AND and OR, and 0 and 1. So the dual of the
            minterm <m>m_1</m> is the maxterm <m>M_1</m>, which is
            <m>x + y + \bar{z}</m>. The dual of the minterm canonical form
            <m>m_1 + m_3 + m_5</m> is the maxterm canonical form
            <m>M_1 \cdot M_3 \cdot M_5</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The maxterm <m>M_1</m> is 0 when <m>x = 0</m>, <m>y = 0</m>, and
            <m>z = 1</m>, and this combination of inputs, that is, the binary
            number <m>001</m>, is the integer 1. The maxterm <m>M_3</m> is 0
            when <m>x = 0</m>, <m>y = 1</m>, and <m>z = 1</m>, and this
            combination of inputs, that is, the binary number <m>011</m>, is
            the integer 3. The maxterm <m>M_5</m> is 1 when <m>x = 1</m>,
            <m>y = 0</m>, and <m>z = 1</m>, and this combination of inputs,
            that is, the binary number <m>101</m>, is the integer 5.
            <xref ref="table-maxterms-three-vars"/> summarizes the situation.
        </p>
        <warning>
            <p>
                Notice that the maxterms are labeled by the integers that make
                them 0, not 1. This is the opposite of the situation with
                minterms.

            The maxterm canonical form for this function is <m>M_0 \cdot M_2
            \cdot M_4 \cdot M_6 \cdot M_7</m>, because maxterms <m>M_0</m>,

                    whose maxterm canonical form you wrote down in the previous
                    activity, and verify that it has the truth table in
                    <xref ref="table-truth-tab-4-vars"/>.

            Expressions that are products of maxterms are called <term>products
            of sums</term>, or <term>POS</term> expressions. The circuit
            corresponding to a POS expression is called a <term>product of
            sums circuit</term>.

        <p>
            The minterm canonical form and the maxterm canonical form are
            called <term>canonical</term> because they are the simplest
            possible expressions for the function. The minterm canonical form
            is the simplest sum of products expression, and the maxterm
            canonical form is the simplest product of sums expression.

                    When is the minterm canonical form simpler than the maxterm
                    canonical form, and vice versa?
