    <title>Problems for Monday, Jan 8</title>
    <p>
      Make sure you can solve all of these problems. Similar ones will appear
      on the midterm. As always in courses at this level, <q>solve</q> means
      to give complete supporting reasoning or justification, not just the answer.
      In this case you should include the details of your calculation, however
      you do it.

        <title>Part A: <c>utils.py</c></title>
        <p>
          Now that we are beginning to have more than one file, it's time to
          start organizing our code. We'll do this by creating a <c>utils.py</c>
          file and moving our <c>binary_write()</c> function into it.
          The <c>code.py</c> file will be the main file, and it will import
          the <c>binary_write()</c> function from the <c>utils.py</c> directory.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use the Mu editor to open a new file on your Pico. Save and name it
          <c>utils.py</c> (put it in the top-level folder alongside
          <c>code.py</c>). Then, move (don't copy) the <c>binary_write()</c>
          function's definition into <c>utils.py</c>. You will also want to include
          any necessary import statements in <c>utils.py</c>. Now, in the
          <c>code.py</c> file, add the following line at the top:
          <cd>
            <cline>from utils import binary_write</cline>
          </cd>
          The meaning of this line is that we are importing the
          <c>binary_write()</c> function from the <c>utils.py</c> file.
          The <c>from ... import ...</c> syntax ensures that
          the short name of the function is available rather than its fully
          qualified name <c>utils.binary_write()</c>. If we do
          <c>import utils</c> instead, then we would need to
          call the function as <c>utils.binary_write()</c>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just as we learn to separate the work of our programs into functions,
          instead of piling everything into one big main function, we should
          also separate our functions into files. This makes it easier to
          organize our code and to find things when we need to change them.

          statements to <c>code.py</c> to make them available.

        <title>Part C: Animations</title>
        <p>
          You can create marquee-style animations by using a loop to turn on
          and off LEDs in a sequence. For example, if you have four LEDs
          connected to pins 0, 1, 2, and 3, you can create a <c>kitt</c>
          animation by turning on the first LED, then the second, then the
          third, then the fourth, then the third, then the second, then the
          first, and then repeating the process. You can use the
          <c>time.sleep()</c> function to pause between
          turning on and off the LEDs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use the <c>binary_write()</c> function to create three different such
          animations. They shouldn't look too much alike. Each one should be enclosed
          in a function, as below. Notice there is no <c>while True</c>
          loop. We want to be able to run it only a few times, which would be
          impossible if we had an infinite loop. Do not duplicate the example as
          one of your submissions.
        </p>
        <p>
          You receive credit for Part C if you can show me three working animation
          cycles (just once through for each is fine) and the code for each uses
          <c>binary_write()</c> to turn on and off the LEDs. The <c>binary_write()</c>
          function must be imported from <c>utils.py</c>. Full credit solutions should
          make use of some of the functions from Part B.

      <title>Project 03: Buttons and Input</title>
      <introduction>
        <p>
          In this project, you'll incorporate input into your circuitry. Make sure
          Project 02 is completed before you start this one.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will need to remove one LED from your circuit to make room for the
          button. I have used its GPIO pin for the button, but you can use any pin
          you like. My concern was a readable diagram.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take care to observe that
          the button is not wired to the breadboard in the same was as the LEDs.
          The LEDs receive the high signal from GPIO through the resistor, and
          then current flows through the LED to ground. The button is wired
          so that the Pico's power rail (make sure this is connected to 3.3V
          on pin 36, not 5V on pin 40 or pin 39) is connected to one leg
          of the button, and the other leg is connected to GPIO.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the button is open (not pressed), no current flows through the
          button (it will be connected to ground through the Pico's internal
          <em>pull-down resistor</em>). When the button is closed (pressed),
          current flows from the power rail through the button to GPIO, pulling
          the GPIO input high. Your code will allow the Pico to detect this
          high voltage and trigger an action.
        </p>
      </introduction>
      <subsubsection xml:id="subsubsec-proj03-a">
        <title>Part A</title>
        <p>
          Wire your button to the breadboard as shown in the diagram below.
          <em>Make sure the power rails (red) are connected to 3.3V only!
            The 5V main power lines will destroy your Pico!</em>

          Then you will need to make some changes in how the pins are initialized.
          Your button pin (GPIO 16 in my diagram) will need to be configured
          as an input. Because we didn't connect the button to ground, we need
          to tell the Pico to use the internal pull-down resistor. This will
          ensure that the input is low when the button is not pressed. The code
          below shows how to do this.
          <cd>
            <cline>import board</cline>
            <cline>import digitalio</cline>
            <cline>import time</cline>
            <cline>from utils import binary_write</cline>
            <cline></cline>
            <cline>LED_PINS_SETUP = [board.GP16, board.GP17, board.GP18, board.GP19,</cline>
            <cline>                  board.GP20, board.GP21, board.GP22, board.GP26]</cline>
            <cline>PINS = [None] * 8</cline>
            <cline>for i, led_pin in enumerate(LED_PINS_SETUP):</cline>
            <cline>    PINS[i] = digitalio.DigitalInOut(led_pin)</cline>
            <cline>    PINS[i].direction = digitalio.Direction.OUTPUT</cline>
            <cline></cline>
            <cline>    PINS[i].value = False</cline>
            <cline></cline>
            <cline>button = PINS[0]</cline>
            <cline>leds = PINS[1:]</cline>
          </cd>
          Without the internal pull-down resistor, the input would be <em>floating</em>
          when the button is not pressed. This means that it would be neither high
          nor low, and it would be impossible to tell whether the button was pressed
          or not. The internal pull-down resistor ensures that the input is low
          when the button is not pressed. Without this software solution,
          we would need to add a physical resistor to the circuit connecting the
          button to ground. The internal pull-down resistor is a convenient
          alternative and they are ubiquitous in microcontrollers.

          The buttons are built so that they connect across the vertical groove
          running down the middle of the breadboard. When the button is connected,
          it electrically connects the two sides of the groove. When the button
          is pressed, both pins on the left side of the groove are connected to
          both pins on the right side of the groove.
        </p>
        <p>
          Make sure all your Project 02 code is safe somewhere (in another file,
          not <c>code.py</c>, on your Pico or your laptop) and then add this code
          to your <c>code.py</c> file:
          <cd>
            <cline>while True:</cline>
            <cline>    if button.value:</cline>
            <cline>        print("Hello sailor!")</cline>
            <cline>        time.sleep(0.5)</cline>
          </cd>
          In the Serial pane, you should see the output when you press the button.
          When you have succeeded, play with the delay time in the call to <c>time.sleep()</c>.
          What happens if you make it too short? What happens if you make it too long?
          Discuss with the people in your group.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will visit each group and check the group off together. Don't move on to
          part C until you are checked off. Instead, work on HW 1.

          The difficulty with using buttons for input is that the Pico has to be listening for
          the button press. If the Pico is busy doing something else, it won't be able to
          respond to the button press. This is why we used the <c>time.sleep()</c> function
          in the example above.
        </p>
        <p>
          Try to adapt your animation code so that your Pico does the following on reset:
          <ol marker="i)">
            <li>
              <p>
                Display a short <q>ready</q> sequence, like flashing all the LEDs
                on and off three times.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Wait for the button to be pressed.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Display the next animation three times.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Go to step 2.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          If you press the button while the animation is running, what happens?
          Is that what you expected, or what a typical user would expect? Discuss
          with the people in your group.

            <p>
              Let <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> be unsigned 2-bit integers,
              and write <m>X = x_1 x_0</m> and <m>Y = y_1 y_0</m>. For
              example, if <m>x_1 = 1</m> and <m>x_0 = 0</m>, then
              <m>X = 2</m>. Similarly, if <m>y_1 = y_0 = 1</m>, then
              <m>Y = 3</m>. In this problem, think of <m>x_0</m>,
              <m>x_1</m>, <m>y_0</m>, and <m>y_1</m> as inputs to a
              digital circuit.

                Write a boolean expression (using AND, OR, NOT operations
                on the input variables <m>x_0</m>,
              <m>x_1</m>, <m>y_0</m>, and <m>y_1</m>) for the condition
              <m>X \gt Y</m>. (So, for example, if <m>X = 2</m> and <m>Y = 3</m>,
              then the formula should evaluate to FALSE.)
