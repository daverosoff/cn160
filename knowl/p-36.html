<div class="para">Because NOR is a universal gate, it is possible to build a computer using only NOR gates. They are cheaper to manufacture than AND and OR gates, and even NOT gates are expressible in terms of NOR. They also are faster: every gate through which a signal passes adds a small delay to the circuit. These are only measured in nanoseconds, but when you have millions of gates, it adds up. NOR gates require less internal wiring than AND and OR gates, so they are faster.</div>
