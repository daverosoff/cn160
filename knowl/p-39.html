<div class="para">The bitwise operators are applied to bit patterns. They are <dfn class="terminology">binary operators</dfn>, meaning that they take two operands. The operands must be of the same length, and the result is a bit pattern of the same length. The bitwise operators are:</div>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Bitwise AND</dfn> &amp; is a binary operator that takes two bit patterns of the same length and returns a bit pattern of the same length. The resulting bit pattern has a 1 bit in each position where both operands have a 1 bit, and a 0 bit in all other positions.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Bitwise OR</dfn> | is a binary operator that takes two bit patterns of the same length and returns a bit pattern of the same length. The resulting bit pattern has a 1 bit in each position where at least one of the operands has a 1 bit, and a 0 bit in all other positions.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Bitwise XOR</dfn> ^ is a binary operator that takes two bit patterns of the same length and returns a bit pattern of the same length. The resulting bit pattern has a 1 bit in each position where exactly one of the operands has a 1 bit, and a 0 bit in all other positions.</div></li>
